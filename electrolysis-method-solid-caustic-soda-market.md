<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrolysis Method Solid Caustic Soda Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ion Exchange Membrane Method</li><li>Diaphragm Electrolysis Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrolysis method for producing solid caustic soda involves two primary technologies: the ion exchange membrane method and the diaphragm electrolysis method. The ion exchange membrane method offers higher purity and efficiency by selectively allowing ions to pass through a membrane, minimizing contamination. In contrast, the diaphragm method uses a physical barrier to separate the anode and cathode compartments, resulting in lower capital costs but potentially lower product purity. Both methods are essential for meeting various industrial demands for caustic soda.</p></p>
