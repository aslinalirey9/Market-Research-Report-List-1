<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Orthose Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial orthosis market is divided into active and passive helmets, each serving distinct purposes in managing head shape abnormalities. Active helmets use dynamic mechanisms, such as an adjustable framework, to actively reshape the skull by applying consistent pressure in specific areas. In contrast, passive helmets provide a protective enclosure without dynamic adjustment; they maintain the head's shape and prevent further distortion. Both types are essential in treating conditions like plagiocephaly and ensuring proper cranial development in infants.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Cranial Orthose Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plagiocephaly</li><li>Scaphocephaly</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial orthosis market primarily addresses conditions like plagiocephaly and scaphocephaly, along with other cranial deformities. Plagiocephaly, characterized by an asymmetrical head shape, often results from prolonged positioning in infancy, while scaphocephaly features a long, narrow head shape typically caused by early fusion of skull bones. Specialized cranial helmets and orthotic devices are designed to gently reshape the skull over time, enhancing both aesthetic appearance and neurological development, ultimately improving the quality of life for affected infants.</p></p>
